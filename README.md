# NewBikes
## Bike Automation Project
This project automates the process of extracting information about **upcoming bikes** and **used cars** from a website, and then attempts a **Google sign-in** to demonstrate error handling. The extracted data and any error screenshots are saved to an Excel file.

## Features
* Cross-browser testing: Supports running tests on Chrome and Edge browsers.
* Upcoming Bikes Data Extraction: Navigates to the "New Bikes" section, filters for "Upcoming Bikes," and extracts details for bikes under a certain price (e.g., 4 Lakhs).
* Used Cars Data Extraction: Searches for used cars in a specified location and extracts the top 5 car names.
* Google Sign-in Attempt: Attempts a Google sign-in with a provided email for demonstration purposes, primarily to trigger a screenshot on error.
* Data Export to Excel: All extracted data and error screenshots are written to an Excel file.
* Screenshot on Error: Captures a screenshot when an error occurs during the Google sign-in attempt.
